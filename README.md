 - [*] Steps that are required in order to reproduce a bug in the system
 - [ ] Sequence of actions required to build a new nodejs server
 - [ ] A process of creation of a new Github repository

2. **What is the role of a helper in nodejs server architecture?** *=> 2 points*
 - [ ] Get the request from the router, treat the request parameters, prepare the response of the server to the consumer

## Section B: Please, explain the following terms the best way you can *=> 22 points*

11. **Constructor** 
	A constructor is a class method that is required to initialize class variables. 	

12. **Connection string** 
	DB Connection string is a string containing information about the database name, connection parameters, and the database connection driver used when initializing the express server.

13. **IDENTITY & SEED**
	The IDENTITY attribute allows you to make a column of numeric type (INT, NUMERIC...) identifier. And the value of this column will be incremented automatically when new data is added to the table.
	SEED point to the value from which the countdown will start. To initialize the SEED initial value, you can use a query DBCC CHECKIDENT ([table_name], RESEED, *last_number_id*).

14. **Abstract class** 
	An abstract class is a class that can be inherited, but cannot be implemented.

15. **Export keyword in nodejs code**
	The export keyword is a command for the compiler that allows you to export a class, definition, or the object itself from a module, to use the object it must be imported in the target module.

 
## Part II: Practice on paper *=> 45 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage. You also may use your development machine for assistance in debugging if needed.*

16. **You received a bug stating the following: "Intermittemtly this method results in an exception in the command line reporting of a Null reference." You're required to find and fix the problem in this method:** *=> 10 points*

    public static addWeeks(date: Date, value: number): Date {
        const tempDate = new Date(date);
        tempDate.setDate(tempDate.getDate() + (7 * value));
        return tempDate;
    }

17. **Having the following DB tables diagram:** *=> 10 points*

![](https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2/blob/dev/resources/db-schema.jpg)

You need to write a query that returns for each user a full data. Consider that not every user in the system has an employee record. In such a case out put "Not an employee". Create By column should include the full name of the user that created the record of this an output user:

| Full name | Created By | Position |
| --- | --- | -- |
| John Doe | Mark Smith | Manager |
| Mary Smith | Klark Smith | Cashier |
| Patrice Raymond | Not an eployee |  |

	SELECT U.first_name + ' ' + U.last_name [Full name], 
		(SELECT CU.first_name + ' ' + CU.last_name
		FROM [user] CU
		WHERE U.create_user_id = CU.id) [Created By],
		(CASE
			WHEN Pos.title IS NULL THEN 'Not an employee'
			ELSE Pos.title
		END) Position
	FROM [user] U
	LEFT JOIN employee Emp ON U.id = Emp.id
	LEFT JOIN position Pos ON Pos.id = Emp.position_id


18. **Write a method in JS/TS that gets as an argument 2 dates and returns a boolean value of whether those dates share the same month**. *=> 5 points*

	function isSameMonth(firstDate: Date, secondDate: Date): boolean {
		return (firstDate.getMonth() === secondDate.getMonth()&&firstDate.getFullYear() === secondDate.getFullYear());
	}

19. **Explain the following piece of code:** *=> 5 points*

        public static dictionaryToArrayOfObjects<T>(input: _.Dictionary<T>): T[] {
            return _.map(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(input), (key: string) => input[key]);
        }

		This function input a dictionary and returns a set of its properties.

20. **Fix the following code and fill the required gaps in it by the coding standards. The purpose of this code is to verify the user is a member of a specific role and in case the user is, a true return value should be returned by the isUserPermitted() method, otherwise false. Treat the comments as actual code written that should not be changed.** *=> 15 points*

		interface user {
			id: number;
			firstName: string;
			lastName: string;
			roles: role;
		}
		
		interface dbUser {
			id: number;
			first_name: string;
			last_name: string;
			role_id: number;
			role_title
		}

		interface role {
			id: number;
			title: string;
		}

		enum Role {
			Administrator = 1,
			RegularUser
		}
		
		public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roles: Role[]): Promise<bool> {
			return new Promise<bool>((resolve, reject) => {
				Promise.all([
					this.getUser(userId),
				])
				.then((user: user) => {
					resolve(user.roles.indexOf(roles[0]) > -1);
				});
			});
		}
		
		private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the user data by id as dbUser or null
			});
		}


## Part III: Practice on dev machine *=> 33 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage*

 - Clone the repository: https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2;
 - Switch to `broken-server` branch;
 - Create a new git repository under your personal Github called `masa-exam-2`;
 - Load the `main` branch of your new repository with the contents of the `broken-server` branch;
 - Each bug in the list should be solved in designated branch.

The following is the list of currently existing problems with the system. :

21. **The server solution cannot be compiled. Fix all compilation issues accordingly.** *=> 10 points*

22. **An attempt to start the server fails reporting "RangeError [ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT]: options.port should be >= 0 and < 65536. Received NaN".** *=> 8 points*

23. **A request to an endpoint GET <serverUrl:port>/user/-1 crashes the server with "ECONNRESET" error.** *=> 5 points*

24. **Add the needed code in order to return a collection of teachers with the current `teacher` interface".** *=> 10 points*

# Good luck!!
